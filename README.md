## 🏺 Why This Matters

Threat actors continually evolve.  
This project helps defenders understand:

- 🔥 *Evasion through rare Unicode planes*  
- 🜂 *Where static scanning becomes blind*  
- 🜄 *Why memory-resident techniques complicate digital forensics*  
- ⚔️ *How detection must adapt before adversaries innovate further*

## 🐺 Inspired by Anubis

Anubis, guardian of hidden pathways and keeper of transitions, symbolizes the **boundary between visible and unseen**.  
This prototype explores that same boundary in modern memory and encoding techniques.

## 🦂 Final Words

As ancient scribes once carved secrets into stone, modern adversaries carve theirs into code.  
Studying these techniques today strengthens the digital defenses of tomorrow.
