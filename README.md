## ⚡ What This Project Explores

**Anubis Loader** is a **research‑focused red team concept** created to study how unusual data representations and system‑level patterns can challenge traditional detection.  
It does *not* contain offensive functionality — it models ideas for defensive learning.

**Key research themes:**

- **Hieroglyphic‑Style Obfuscation**  
  Uses rare Unicode ranges (e.g., Egyptian‑style glyphs: `𓀀𓀁𓀂𓀃`) to explore how exotic characters may impact pattern‑based detection.

- **In‑Memory Behavior Modeling**  
  Simulates how minimal‑artifact operations can affect visibility and monitoring.

- **Benign Process Imitation Study**  
  Demonstrates how normal‑looking activity may influence behavioral analytics.

- **Network Signal Obfuscation Concepts**  
  Examines how unusual data encoding could blend into legitimate traffic patterns.

- **Timestamp Manipulation Awareness**  
  Highlights how altered metadata can complicate basic forensic triage.

All elements are **theoretical**, **restricted**, and **designed for defender education**.
